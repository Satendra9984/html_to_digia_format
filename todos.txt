1: Separated dg widgets and fg widgets 
2: Dg widgets will be prioritized based on component name (WidgetMapper.getWidgetName()) for more details
3: Changed UiObjectModelBase 

Conclusion: Figured out the first version of my parser

[TODO]
1) Complete the guidelines discussion
2) Extract widgets data for making the widgets data for digia_json
3) Complete all widgets list



OPTIMIZATION
1) Remove group/frame with a single child: 
     1) Either before parsing in figmajson
     2) In the final digia json through recursion
     3) During parsing(GROUP/FRAME) just return child if it has only one children   

// WIDGETS DONE


h1-h6      : text
p,h1,h6    : richtext
button     : button 
ul,ol      : listview
li         : listtile
div        : column, grid, flex-container/column
// in this case we will use gridview only and set as per grid, column
