In CSS, the `display` attribute specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. It determines how an element is displayed in the document layout. The `display` property can take various values, each with its own behavior. Here are some common values of the `display` property and their comparison with Flutter widgets:

1. **`display: block;`**
   - In CSS: The element generates a block-level box, meaning it starts on a new line and stretches to fill the width of its containing element.
   - Comparison with Flutter: In Flutter, a `Container` widget with no explicit width constraint behaves similarly to a block-level element, taking up the available width in its parent widget.

2. **`display: inline;`**
   - In CSS: The element generates an inline-level box, meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
   - Comparison with Flutter: There isn't a direct equivalent in Flutter since widgets in Flutter generally do not behave like inline-level elements in HTML. However, you can achieve similar behavior by using `Text` widgets within a `Row` or `Wrap` widget.

3. **`display: flex;`**
   - In CSS: The element becomes a flex container, and its children become flex items. Flexbox layout allows for flexible and responsive layouts, controlling the alignment and distribution of children along a main axis and a cross axis.
   - Comparison with Flutter: The `Row`, `Column`, `Flex`, and `Wrap` widgets in Flutter provide similar flexbox-like layout capabilities, allowing you to arrange child widgets along a main axis and a cross axis, with control over alignment and spacing.

4. **`display: grid;`**
   - In CSS: The element becomes a grid container, and its children become grid items. Grid layout allows for more complex layouts with rows and columns, and precise control over the placement and alignment of items within the grid.
   - Comparison with Flutter: While Flutter does not have a direct equivalent to CSS grid, you can achieve similar grid-like layouts using combinations of `Column`, `Row`, `Flex`, and `Expanded` widgets along with the `GridView` or `CustomMultiChildLayout` widgets for more complex scenarios.

These are some common values of the `display` property in CSS and their comparisons with Flutter widgets. Flutter's widget-based approach offers similar capabilities to CSS layout properties but uses a different paradigm based on composing widgets to achieve desired layouts and UI structures.
